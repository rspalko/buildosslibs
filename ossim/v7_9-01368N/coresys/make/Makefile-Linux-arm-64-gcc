# NOTE: This makefile has not yet been tested.  It may work out of the
# box for ARM processors, or at least serve as a guide for those
# developing for ARM.  The file essentially follows the x86 Linux
# make files, except that it defines KDU_NEON_INTRINSICS and INCLUDE_NEON,
# conditionally either adding "-mfpu=neon" or defining KDU_NO_NEON.
# Importantly, when INCLUDE_NEON is defined, this is picked up by the
# imported "Targets.mk" file and used to include all the relevant
# Neon accelerators for ARM.  You can verify that this is happening
# by listing the NEON related object files "ls neon*.o" that get created.
