This object provides a high level interface to the
Kakadu decompression machinery, which is capable of
satisfying the needs of most developers while providing
essentially a one-function-call solution for simple
applications. Most new developers will probably wish
to base their decompression applications either upon
this object, or the 
<A HREF="kdu$essor.html">kdu_region_decompressor</A> object.
</P><P>
 It should be noted, however, that some performance
benefits can be obtained by directly interfacing with
the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A> object or, at an even lower level, directly creating
your own 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A> and/or 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A> objects, from which to pull individual image lines
&mdash; these approaches can often avoid unnecessary
copying and level shifting of image samples. Nevertheless,
there has been a lot of demand for a dead-simple, yet
also powerful interface to Kakadu, and this object
is intended to fill that requirement. In fact, the
various objects found in the "support" directory (
<A HREF="kdu$1essor.html">kdu_stripe_compressor</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$essor.html">kdu_region_decompressor</A>) are all aimed at meeting the needs of 90% of the
applications using Kakadu. That is not to say that
these objects are all that is required. You still need
to open streams of one form or another and create a
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface.
</P><P>
 In a typical decompression application based on this
object, you will need to do the following:
</P><UL><LI>
Create a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> object.
</LI><LI>
Optionally use one of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> functions to adjust the portion of the original compressed
image that you want to recover &mdash; you can also
use these functions to configure the set of image components
you want decompressed and whether or not you want any
multi-component transforms to be inverted.
</LI><LI>
Initialize the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor</A> object, by calling 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::start</A>.
</LI><LI>
Pull image stripes from 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::pull_stripe</A> until the image is fully decompressed (you can do
it all in one go, into a memory buffer of your choice,
if you like).
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">kdu_stripe_decompressor::finish</A> (not strictly necessary).
</LI><LI>
Call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__destroy.html">kdu_codestream::destroy</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 For a tuturial example of how to use the present object
in a typical application, consult the Kakadu demo application,
"kdu_buffered_decompress".
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that this object is built directly
on top of the services offered by 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, so for a thorough understanding of how things work,
you might like to consult the documentation for that
object as well.
</P><P>
 Most notably, the image components manipulated by
this object are those which are described by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> machinery as output image components, as opposed to
codestream image components. For a discussion of the
differences between codestream and output image components,
see the second form of the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function. For our purposes here, however, it is sufficient
to note that output components are derived from codestream
components by applying any multi-component (or decorrelating
colour) transforms. Output components are the image
components which the content creator intends to be
rendered. Note, however, that if the component access
mode is set to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A> instead of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A> (see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>), the codestream image components will appear to be
the output components, so no loss of flexibility is
incurred by insisting that this object processes output
components.
</P><P>
 To take advantage of multi-threading, you need to
create a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object, add a suitable number of working threads to
it (see comments appearing with the definition of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>) and pass it into the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> function. You can re-use this 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object as often as you like &mdash; that is, you need
not tear down and recreate the collaborating multi-threaded
environment between calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>. Multi-threading could not be much simpler. The only
thing you do need to remember is that all calls to
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__pull_stripe__1.html">pull_stripe</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> should be executed from the same thread &mdash; the
one identified by the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference passed to 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A>. This constraint represents a slight loss of flexibility
with respect to the core processing objects such as
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>, which allow calls from any thread. In exchange, however,
you get simplicity. In particular, you only need to
pass the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object into the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> function, after which the object remembers the thread
reference for you.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu version 7.5, the implementation of this
object has been provided with two different cleanup
methods, embodied by the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__reset.html">reset</A> functions. Previously, 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> cleaned up all resources and was implicitly invoked
by the destructor; however, this was dangerous since
it may have led to the use of a 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> reference supplied with 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> that became invalid before the object was destroyed.
The destructor now implicitly invokes 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__reset.html">reset</A>, but that function may be called explicitly to re-use
the object after a failure or premature termination
condition &mdash; be sure to read the documentation
for 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__reset.html">reset</A> very carefully, since it requires that you first wait
for any multi-threaded processing to terminate.
</P><P>
 Connected with this change, it is worth noting that
the 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> function no longer de-allocates all physical memory
resources that the object may have allocated. This
is useful, since it allows the memory to be re-used
when 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__start.html">start</A> is called again, without the overhead of re-allocation
and potentially moving the memory to a disadvantageous
location in a NUMA environment. In most applications
where instances of this object experience multiple
<B>create</B>/
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> cycles, the new behaviour can speed things up without
any changes required at the application level. However,
if you were somehow relying upon 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A> deleting all physical memory, keeping many instances
of the object around without invoking their destructor,
you may have to modify your application to explicitly
invoke 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__reset.html">reset</A> after 
<A HREF="kdu$2essor__finish.html">finish</A>.
